The Heltec V3 is our top recommendation for first-time Meshtastic users in Charleston. It's inexpensive enough to experiment with and capable enough for daily use.

## What's Included

- Heltec LoRa 32 V3 board
- Basic 915 MHz antenna
- (Sometimes) USB cable

## What You'll Want to Add

- Better antenna (see our antenna guide)
- Case or enclosure
- External battery pack for extended use

## Charleston Performance

Works great for urban use in Charleston. With the stock antenna, expect 1-2 mile range in downtown. With an upgraded antenna, 3-5+ miles is achievable.
