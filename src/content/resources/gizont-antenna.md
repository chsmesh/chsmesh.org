The single best upgrade you can make to your Meshtastic setup. Replacing the stock antenna with this ~$10 upgrade can double or triple your effective range.

## Why Upgrade?

Stock antennas are designed to be cheap and small, not performant. A proper 915MHz antenna:
- Has correct tuning for the frequency
- Provides actual gain
- Improves both transmit and receive

## Installation

Simply unscrew your existing antenna and screw this one on. Make sure your device uses SMA (not RP-SMA or U.FL).
