## Overview

Choosing your first Meshtastic device can be overwhelming. This guide breaks down the options and helps you pick the right one for your needs.

## Quick Recommendations

**Just want an answer?** Here's what we recommend: (prices may be out-of-date)

| Use Case | Recommendation | Price |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| First device, general use | Heltec V3 | ~$20-25 |
| GPS tracking important | LilyGo T-Beam | ~$35-45 |
| Maximum portability | Heltec V3 | ~$20-25 |
| Solar/permanent install | RAK WisBlock | ~$50-80 |
| Premium experience | Station G2 | ~$80-100 |

## Key Considerations

### 1. Built-in GPS

Some devices have GPS built in, others don't:

- **With GPS**: LilyGo T-Beam, RAK WisBlock (with GPS module), Station G2
- **Without GPS**: Heltec V3, most basic boards

If you want to share your location or track assets, get a device with GPS. If you just want messaging from a fixed location, you can skip it.

### 2. Screen

Having a screen lets you:
- See messages without your phone
- Check battery status
- View node information

Most popular devices (Heltec, T-Beam) include small OLED screens.

### 3. Battery

- **Heltec V3**: Small internal battery holder, limited capacity
- **T-Beam**: 18650 battery slot - easy to swap, high capacity
- **Station G2**: Built-in battery with USB-C charging

For portable use, the T-Beam's swappable 18650 batteries are convenient.

### 4. Case/Enclosure

Consider whether you want:
- A bare board (cheapest, most hackable)
- A basic case (protects the device)
- A weatherproof enclosure (for outdoor installation)

## Our Charleston Recommendation

For Charleston specifically, we recommend the **Heltec V3** or **T-Beam** because:

1. **Flat terrain** - We don't need extreme range; mesh density matters more
2. **Hurricane prep** - Swappable batteries (T-Beam) or USB power banks work great
3. **Community support** - Most local members use these devices, so help is available

## What Else You'll Need

Regardless of device, plan to get:

1. **Better antenna** - The included antennas are often mediocre. A $10-15 upgrade makes a big difference.
2. **Case** (if not included) - 3D printed or purchased
3. **Power solution** - USB power bank, battery, or wall adapter

## Next Steps

Once you've chosen your device:

1. Order it (Amazon for speed, AliExpress for savings)
2. While waiting, join our Discord and introduce yourself
3. Read the [Flashing Firmware](/guides/flashing-firmware) guide
4. Come to a meetup - we can help with initial setup!
