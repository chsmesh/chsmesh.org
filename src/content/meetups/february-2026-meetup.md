## What to Expect

Our monthly meetups are casual, welcoming gatherings for anyone interested in Meshtastic and mesh networking. Whether you're brand new or an experienced operator, you'll find something valuable.

### Typical Agenda

- **2:00 PM** - Doors open, casual networking
- **2:30 PM** - Brief introductions and community updates
- **2:45 PM** - Tech talk or demo (topic varies each month)
- **3:30 PM** - Open hacking / Q&A / node setup help
- **4:00 PM** - Wrap up

### This Month's Focus

We'll be covering **antenna basics** - understanding SWR, antenna types, and how to maximize your range without breaking FCC rules. Bring your antenna if you have questions about it!

### What to Bring

- Your Meshtastic device (if you have one)
- Laptop for configuration (optional)
- Questions!

### First Timer?

Don't have a device yet? No problem! Come anyway - we often have demo units available and can help you decide what to buy. Many of our members started by attending a meetup first.

## Location

Redux Coffee has great coffee and plenty of space. Street parking is available on Columbus St and nearby streets.
