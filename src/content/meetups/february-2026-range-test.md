## Event Overview

It's time for our semi-annual range test! We're organizing a coordinated effort to test mesh coverage across the Charleston area.

### How It Works

1. **Sign up** on Discord with your planned location
2. **Position your node** at your location by 9 AM
3. **Send test messages** at scheduled intervals
4. **Document results** in our shared spreadsheet

### Planned Test Points

We're looking for volunteers at these strategic locations:

- Ravenel Bridge (pedestrian area)
- Mount Pleasant Pier
- Sullivan's Island
- Folly Beach Pier
- Downtown Charleston (rooftop)
- James Island County Park
- North Charleston (elevated location)

### What You'll Need

- Meshtastic device (fully charged or with power source)
- Phone with Meshtastic app
- Way to share your location/results

### Why This Matters

Range tests help us:
- Document actual coverage areas
- Identify gaps in the network
- Find optimal locations for permanent relay nodes
- Build a coverage map for new users

## Post-Event

After the test, we'll compile results and update our coverage map. All participants will be credited in our documentation.
