fix-001: Eliminated docker.sock exposure by removing watchtower from docker-compose.server.yml and shifting updates to host-level script (scripts/server-update.sh). Added regression test to prevent docker.sock mount reintroduction.
fix-002: Hardened nginx runtime by running as non-root (UID/GID 101), switching to unprivileged port 8080, enforcing read-only root filesystem with tmpfs exceptions, dropping all Linux capabilities, and enabling no-new-privileges in compose files. Added regression tests for hardened container controls.
fix-003: Pinned production deployment image in docker-compose.server.yml to an immutable sha256 digest and documented the reviewed digest update workflow in README. Added regression test to enforce digest-pinned image references and block mutable :latest tags.
